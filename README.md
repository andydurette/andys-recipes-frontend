# React Section of AWS CDK No Story Recipes Site

I have always wanted to have my own personal recipe site where there isn't stories or talks of peoples lives just the recipes themselves simplified down for an amateur cook like myself.

So as a method of learning AWS CDK I decided to build it.

This is an ongoing build project where features are still being added.

Features, checkmarks are done, crosses are features yet to be added

- Authentication and Authorization, kept only to myself to avoid AWS costs. ✅
- Ability to create recipes inside the app via a GUI✅
- Ability to update recipes inside the app via a GUI ❌
- Add images to display with recipes from an S3 bucket. ✅
- Proper Integration of typescript into code ❌
- Adding tests for functionalities ❌
